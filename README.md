# local-airflow

This repository aims to build a robust infrastructure tailored for optimizing machine learning workflows. Leveraging the power of Docker, this setup ensures a seamless and scalable environment for handling various aspects of machine learning projects.

## Core Components

The infrastructure integrates several key open-source services, each chosen for its effectiveness in handling specific facets of machine learning processes:

- **Airflow**: Serves as the backbone for process orchestration. It enables you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows, ensuring efficient management of complex data pipelines.

- **Postgres**: Acts as our SQL database. Renowned for its reliability and performance, Postgres offers a secure and robust storage solution for managing structured data essential in ML modeling and analysis.

- **MinIO**: Provides a high-performance, AWS S3 compatible object storage system. It's designed for storing and managing large volumes of unstructured data, making it ideal for datasets commonly used in machine learning.

- **MLflow**: A crucial component for monitoring all aspects of the machine learning lifecycle. MLflow tracks experiments, records and compares parameters and results, and assists in model deployment, making it an indispensable tool for maintaining the quality and efficiency of ML models.

With these integrated services, the infrastructure provides a comprehensive platform for managing, tracking, and optimizing machine learning projects from start to finish.
